- [x] **429 Status Code**: Correct HTTP status code response

### 3. CORS Security Configuration
- [x] **Origin Restriction**: Only allow specified domains
- [x] **Method Restriction**: Only allow GET and POST
- [x] **Header Restriction**: Only allow necessary headers

### 4. CloudFormation Security Groups

- [x] **HTTPS Support**: Added port 443 support
- [x] **Description Tags**: Added descriptions for each rule
- [x] **Egress Rules**: Explicitly set outbound traffic rules

### 5. IAM Roles and Permissions

- [x] **Health Checks**: Improved health check mechanism

### 7. Environment Variables Security
- [x] **Sensitive Data Separation**: Created production environment configuration examples
- [x] **Password Strength**: Require strong password settings
- [x] **Configuration Guide**: Detailed security configuration instructions

## üö® Pre-deployment Security Checks

### Environment Variables Configuration
- [ ] Confirm `ALLOWED_ORIGINS` is set to correct domains
- [ ] Set strong passwords for `SECRET_KEY` and `JWT_SECRET_KEY`
- [ ] Confirm `FLASK_DEBUG=False` in production environment
- [ ] Set appropriate rate limiting parameters

### AWS Configuration
- [ ] Confirm EC2 instances use IAM roles
- [ ] Check security group rules are correct
- [ ] Confirm CloudFront uses HTTPS
- [ ] Set appropriate S3 bucket policies

### Monitoring and Logging
- [ ] Enable CloudWatch logs
- [ ] Set up log rotation
- [ ] Configure monitoring alerts
- [ ] Test error handling mechanisms

## üîç Regular Security Checks

### Weekly Checks
- [ ] Check system updates
- [ ] Review logs for unusual activities
- [ ] Confirm rate limiting is working properly

### Monthly Checks
- [ ] Rotate passwords and API keys
- [ ] Check IAM permissions
- [ ] Update dependency packages
- [ ] Review security group rules

### Quarterly Checks
